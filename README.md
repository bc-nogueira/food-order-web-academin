# Food Order Project

This is a basic project made with React for studying purposes. It's a food order web app where you can add and remove items from a cart. You can view your cart with the total price for the order. The data is not persisted so it will reload every time the page is refreshed.

I coded along during the course [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/#instructor-2) by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller at Udemy.

## My changes

Everything included in the first commit is from the original project. All later commits are changes that I made to the project. These changes include:

- Delete an item directly without having to remove the total amount of the item one by one
